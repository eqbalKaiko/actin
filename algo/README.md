## ACTIN-Algo

ACTIN-Algo matches a patient record (clinical & molecular data) with available treatments.

This application requires Java 11+ and can be run as follows: 

```
java -cp actin.jar com.hartwig.actin.algo.TreatmentMatcherApplication \
   -clinical_json /path/to/clinical.json \
   -molecular_json /path/to/molecular.json \
   -treatment_database_directory /path/to/potential_treatment_options \
   -output_directory /path/where/output/is/written \
```

The following assumptions are made about the inputs:
 - The clinical JSON adheres to the format that is generated by [ACTIN-Clinical](../clinical/README.md).
 - The molecular JSON is the [ORANGE](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/blob/master/orange/README.md) 
 output from the [Hartwig platinum pipeline](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/platinum)
 - The treatment database directory is the output directory of [ACTIN-Treatment](../treatment/README.md)
