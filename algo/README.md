## ACTIN-Algo

ACTIN-Algo matches a patient record (clinical & molecular data) with available treatments.

This application requires Java 11+ and can be run as follows: 

```
java -cp actin.jar com.hartwig.actin.algo.TreatmentMatcherApplication \
   -clinical_json /path/to/clinical.json \
   -molecular_json /path/to/molecular.json \
   -treatment_database_directory /path/to/potential_treatment_options \
   -doid_json /path/to/full_doid_tree_json_file \
   -output_directory /path/where/output/is/written \
```

The following assumptions are made about the inputs:
 - The clinical JSON adheres to the format that is generated by [ACTIN-Clinical](../clinical/README.md)
 - The molecular JSON is the [ORANGE](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/blob/master/orange/README.md) 
 output from the [Hartwig platinum pipeline](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/platinum)
 - The treatment database directory is the output directory of [ACTIN-Treatment](../treatment/README.md)
 
### Treatment matching

Every treatment defined in the treatment database is evaluated independently. 

In case a treatment is a trial, all relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria are evaluated for this trial as well as every criterion 
for any specific cohort within this trial.  

Every criterion evaluates to one of the following options:

Evaluation | Description
---|---
PASS | The patient complies with the inclusion or exclusion criterion.  
PASS_BUT_WARN | The patient complies with the inclusion or exclusion criterion but a manual check is required.
FAIL | The patient does not comply with the inclusion or exclusion criterion. 
UNDETERMINED | The data provided to the inclusion or exclusion criterion is insufficient for determining eligibility.
NOT_IMPLEMENTED | No algo has been defined yet for this criterion.

For every trial (and cohort) an overall evaluation is determined using the following algorithm:
 1. A patient is eligible for a trial (or cohort) only in case all criteria are `PASS` or `PASS_BUT_WARN`.
 1. In case one of the criteria evaluates to a `FAIL` the patient fails overall eligibility for the trial (or cohort). 
 1. In case of no fails but at least one `UNDETERMINED` or `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` evaluation, the overall evaluation is determined 
 to be `UNDETERMINED`.    

The following additional rules are applied for trials versus cohorts:
 1. A patient is eligible for a specific cohort only if the overall evaluation for both the cohort as well as the trial itself are passed.
 1. A patient is eligible for a trial only if it is eligible for at least one of the cohorts within the trial or if the trial has no 
 cohorts defined and the patient passes all criteria for the trial.  

#### Individual criteria algorithms

Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be defined as a set of rules that are combined using composite functions, to determine overall eligibility. 

The following composite functions are available:

Function | Description 
---|---
AND | indicates that all combined rules should be TRUE in order to PASS
OR | indicates that either of combined rules should be TRUE in order to PASS
NOT | indicates that the rule should not be TRUE in order to PASS
WARN_ON_PASS | indicates that a warning should be displayed in case of PASS and resolves to PASS_BUT_WARN

Some rules require an additional configuration parameter ("X") that can be set to match the requirements of each trial. Also, note that some inclusion and exclusion criteria can be mapped to rules that are currently explicitly set to PASS or explicitly ignored. 

The following rules are available:
