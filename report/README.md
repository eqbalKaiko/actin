## ACTIN-Report

ACTIN-report generates a PDF based on all data fed into ACTIN and generated by [ACTIN-Algo](../algo/README.md).
An example PDF can be found [here](src/main/resources/example.actin.pdf)

ACTIN-Report requires Java 11+ and can be run as follows: 

```
java -cp actin.jar com.hartwig.actin.report.ReportApplication \
   -clinical_json /path/to/clinical.json \
   -molecular_json /path/to/orange.json \
   -output_directory /path/where/pdf/is/written \
```

The following assumptions are made about the inputs:
 - The clinical JSON adheres to the format that is generated by [ACTIN-Clinical](../clinical/README.md).
 - The molecular JSON is the [ORANGE](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/blob/master/orange/README.md) 
 output from the [Hartwig platinum pipeline](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/platinum)
